# Web Design Homework - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

## Background

Data is more powerful when we share it with others! Let's take what we've learned about HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing off the analysis we've done.
## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I've created in a past assignment. Specifically, be plotting [weather data]

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which to navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

### Website Requirements

The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:

* A [landing page](#landing-page) containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page.
* Four [visualization pages](#visualization-pages), each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A ["Comparisons" page](#comparisons-page) that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so to easily visually compare them.
  * Used a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
* A ["Data" page](#data-page) that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
